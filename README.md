# 💫 About Me:
AI, ML & Data Science Learner | CSE Student 💻<br>
<br>
Hi, I'm a Computer Science Engineering student with a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science.

I am currently in the learning phase, focusing on building strong fundamentals and applying concepts through hands-on practice and projects. I enjoy learning by doing, experimenting with ideas, and improving step by step.

My repositories mainly reflect my learning journey, including practice projects, experiments, and implementations of concepts I am studying. The goal is continuous improvement rather than perfection.

I am actively preparing for internships and opportunities that allow me to gain real-world experience, learn from challenges, and grow as a tech professional.

📌 Always open to learning, feedback, and collaboration.
